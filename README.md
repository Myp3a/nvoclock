# nvoclock

[![release-badge][]][cargo] [![license-badge][]][license]

`nvoclock` is a command-line interface to NVAPI that supports full monitoring
and overclocking of NVIDIA GPUs on Windows platforms.

## Download

[Binary downloads](https://github.com/arcnmx/nvoclock/releases) are available
here on Github for both x86 and x86_64 Windows platforms. No installer
necessary, just bring the GPU and ensure the drivers are installed properly. It
can also be installed and built from source using `cargo install nvoclock`

## Features

While the interface may be a bit clunky, it supports everything you'd expect out
of a modern overclocking tool:

- GPU detection and displaying of stats, capabilities, etc. similar to GPU-Z
- Monitor the status of a GPU including power draw, load usage, clocks, voltage,
  temperatures, fans, and so on - anything Afterburner would have a chart for
- Fan control, thermal, and power limits
- Traditional (pstate) offset overclocking
- GPU Boost 3.0 frequency curve controls (VFP)
  - Import/export to CSV file
  - Voltage lock (single point testing)
  - Don't try the "auto" subcommand
- Pascal voltage boost

## Usage

- `nvoclock info` displays information about the capabilities of detected GPUs
- `nvoclock status` displays monitoring information about the GPU
  - `nvoclock status -a` shows some fancy tables!
  - Use in combination with [watch(1)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/watch) for
    best results.
- `nvoclock set` encompasses the usual options to overclock and tweak a GPU.
  Check `-h` for all the details.

### Global Options

- `-g 0` flag can be used to filter results and operations to a specific GPU
- `-O json` prints out information in JSON format to be parsed or handled by
  automated scripts.
- `set RUST_LOG=trace` to get excessive debugging information. You'll probably
  want to use `nvoclock info 2> nvolog.txt` to save to a file for later
  interpretation.

## Future Items

Some things can be improved, and since most testing was done with a single
pascal GPU there are some missing features for older hardware.

- Previous generation GPUs need testing/support
  - Overvolting support needs doing
- RPC API + Daemon
  - Controls from another computer so autodetect can detect and survive crashes
    and full lock-ups.
  - Running on a VFIO host to control a guest GPU would be neat. SSH mostly does
    this already though.

## Out of Scope

`nvoclock` isn't meant to be an all-encompassing overclocking and monitoring
tool. The following features would better belong in a separate project:

- GUI ([nvapi-rs](https://crates.io/crates/nvapi) does all the real work and
  makes it easy to create one though!)
- AMD GPU support
- CPU monitoring and/or overclocking
- Status overlays and game hooks
- Linux support (`nvapi` is not available)
- Software fan curve control (I'll get around to a daemon for this eventually)
